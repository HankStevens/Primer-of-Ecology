# Life History Theory {#lht}

Life history theory explains variation among individuals, populations, and species in traits related to growth, survival, and reproduction. Such traits include, the number of seed per flower, the average size of an individual at birth, generation time, life span and others. It assumes that natural selection finds shapes these traits in myriad ways resulting in wide variation in these traits, and tradeoffs among these traits.

Natural selection can be thought of as an optimizing process: phenotypes diversify, winners replicate and losers don't, and the phenotypes of winners tend to get passed on to the replicants. We therefore often assume, as did Dr. Pangloss, that the species that exist now are the best of all possible species, that is, they are of optimal design. And like Dr. Pangloss, we would be woefully mistaken if we stopped there.
