It is my hope that readers can enjoy the \emph{ecological content} and ignore the R code, if they care to.  Toward this end, I tried to make the code easy to ignore, by either putting boxes around it, or simply concentrating code in some sections and keeping it out of other sections.

It is also my hope that ecologists interested in learning R will have a rich yet gentle introduction to this amazing programming language. Toward that end, I have included some useful functions in an R package called \texttt{primer}. Like nearly all R packages, it is available through the R projects repositories, the CRAN mirrors. See the Appendix for an introduction to the R language.

I have a hard time learning something on my own, unless I can \emph{do} something with the material. Learning  ecology is no different, and I find that my students and I learn theory best when we write down formulae, manipulate them, and explore consequences of rearrangement. This typically starts with copying down, verbatim, an expression in a book or paper. Therefore, I encourage readers to take pencil to paper, and fingers to keyboard, and copy expressions they see in this book. After that, make sure that what I have done is correct by trying some of the same rearrangements and manipulations I have done. In addition, try things that aren't in the book --- have fun.

\paragraph{A pedagogical suggestion}
For centuries, musicians and composers have learned their craft in part by \emph{copying by hand} to works of others. Physical embodiment of the musical notes and their sequences helped them learn composition. I have it on great authority that most theoreticians (and other mathematicians) do the same thing --- they start by copying down mathematical expressions. This physical process helps get the content under their skin and through their skull. I encourage you to do the same. Whether otherwise indicated or not, let the first assigned problem at the end of each chapter be to copy down, with a pencil and paper, the mathematical expression presented in that chapter. In my own self-guided learning, I have often taken this simple activity for granted and have discounted its value --- to my own detriment. I am not surprised how often students also take this activity for granted, and similarly suffer the consequences. \emph{Seeing} the logic of something is not always enough --- sometimes we have to actually \emph{recreate} the logic for ourselves.

Using a text editor (such as the simple one in the R GUI) is one of the huge benefits of using R. Using a text editor to write code and to make extensive comments to yourself (and others!) makes R \emph{truly} interactive. You interact with yourself by putting your thoughts on (virtual) paper, highlighting concepts and details you learn along the way, and documenting clearly what it is you have done. The code and the comments are two halves of the whole. Your comments also allow you to interact with others in a very complete way. You cannot realistically and reliably interact with others unless you put something in writing. If you use an application that is a pure GUI, you would have to describe the buttons you click and be absolutely certain that you leave nothing out and that you can actually communicate what you did. By writing and commenting code, you can send your scripts to anyone (your advisor, your instructor, your students, employees, boss, regulatory agency, collaborators\ldots).
