Right: Neutral ecological drift. Ten species, 90 individuals, undergo random walks within finite local community, immigration. , one generation equal nine deaths nine births. Note slow decline unevenness — 1000 deaths, species become extinct.\nrelevant world NTBB metacommunity (left, Fig. 14.9), , collection local communities connected dispersal (Leibold et al. 2004).88 metacommunity populated entirely individuals functionally identical. NTBB theory dynamics individuals, modeling individual births, deaths, migration mutation. assumes within guild, late successional tropical trees, species essentially neutral respect fitness, , exhibit fitness equivalence. means probabilities birth, death, mutation migration identical individuals. Therefore, changes population sizes occur via random walks, , via stochastic increases decreases time step (right, Fig. 14.9). Random walks imply absence competition indirect enemy mediated negative density dependence. Rather, competition thought diffuse, equal among individuals. discuss details context simulation. Negative density dependence arises either specific constraint total number individuals community (Hubbell 2001), traits individuals related probabilities births, deaths, speciation (Volkov et al. 2005).basic paradox NTBB, absence migration mutation, diversity gradually declines zero, monodominance. random walk due fitness equivalence eventually result loss species except one. However, loss diversity single local community predicted , slow, countered immigration speciation (discuss details ). Thus, species increase deterministically rare — makes concept coexistence different stable coexistance criteria discussed previous chapters. Coexistance stable rather stochastic event limited time horizon balanced emergence new species.communities thought undergo random walks toward monodominance, diversity maintained particular region? Two factors maintain species local community. First, immigration local community metacommunity can bring new species. Even though local community undergoing random walk toward monodominance, local community may become dominated one species pool species equal fitness. Thus separate local communities predicted become dominated different species, differences among local communities help maintain diversity metacommunity landscape.89 Second, longer time scales larger spatial scales, speciation (.e., mutation lineage-splitting) within entire metacommunity maintains biodiversity. Mutation consequent speciation provide ultimate source variation. Random walks toward extinction large communities lengthy extinctions balanced speciation.Introducing new symbols jargon ecological neutral theory, state diversity metacommunity, \\(\\theta\\), function number individuals metacommunity, \\(J_M\\), per capita rate new species arise (via mutation) \\(\\nu\\) (\\(\\theta = 2J_M \\nu\\); Table 14.1). local community undergoes ecological drift; drift causes slow loss diversity, balanced per capita (\\(J_L\\)) immigration rate \\(m\\).\nTable 14.1: Comparison properties jargon used ecological population genetic neutral theory (Alonso, Etienne, McKane 2006). \\(x\\) continuous variable relative abundance species allele (\\(0 \\le x \\le 1\\), \\(x = n/J\\)).

Chesson makes important distinction stabilizing mechanisms, create attractors, equalizing mechanisms, reduce differences among species, slow competitive exclusion facilitate stabilization (Chesson 2000a).NTBB spurred tremendous debate roles chance determinism, dispersal-assembly niche-assembly, evolutionary processes ecology, go ‘community ecology’ (see, e.g., articles Functional Ecology, 19(1), 2005; Ecology, 87(6), 2006). theory narrowest sense falsified field experiments observation studies (Clark McLachlan 2003; Wootton Emmerson 2005). However, degree stochasticity \ndispersal versus niche partitioning structure communities\nremains generally unknown. Continued refinements elaboration (e.g., Volkov et al.
