<p>Here we discuss epidemiological disease models. Pathogens cause diseases, and are typically defined as microorganisms (fungi, bacteria, and viruses) with some host specificity, and which undergo population growth within the host. The curious reader may want to consult <span class="citation">S. P. Ellner and Guckenheimer (<a href="references.html#ref-ellner:2006qe">2006</a>)</span> and <span class="citation">Bjornstad (<a href="references.html#ref-bjornstad2018b">2018</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>I think, without tons of evidence, that one nice aspect of disease ecology and the use epidemiological models is that they have helped ecologists feel more comfortable with short term dynamics and also the importance of prediction. Human epidemiology is rightly obsessed with understanding the disease outbreak in front of us, whether it is the common cold, or SARS-CoV-2 and how to alter its course. It is even more interested in being able to predict the course of an outbreak. In contrast, ecology has often been more interested in asymptotic dynamics rather than short term, and more on understanding than prediction. There is a place for everything, and it is good to see the two having merged a bit.</p>
<p>Our simplest models of disease are funny, in that they don’t model pathogens (the enemy) at all. These famous models, by <span class="citation">Kermack and McCormick (<a href="references.html#ref-kermack:1927fk">1927</a>)</span>, keep track of different types of hosts, primarily those with and without disease:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Susceptible hosts</strong> Individuals which are not infected, but could become infected,</li>
<li>
<strong>Infected hosts</strong> Individuals which are already infected, and</li>
<li>
<strong>Resistant hosts</strong> Individuals which are resistant to the disease, typically assumed to have built up an immunity through past exposure,</li>
</ul>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(N=S+I+R\)</span>. It is important to note that <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(I\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> are <em>densities</em>. That is, we track numbers of individuals in a fixed area. This is important because it has direct consequences for the spread, or transmission, of disease <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-mccallum2001">McCallum, Barlow, and Hone 2001</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Disease spreads from infected individuals to susceptible individuals. The rate depends to some extent on the number or alternatively, on the fraction of the population that is infected. Resistant individuals are not typically considered vectors of the pathogens, and so increased abundance of resistant individuals slow the transmission rate by diluting the other two groups.</p>

<p>A good starting place is the simplest SIR models, that for a <em>closed</em> epidemic. By this we mean that births, deaths, and migration are essentially zero, such that we have a fixed population size. This is a reasonable assumption over relatively short time intervals, which is fine if we are interested in the progression of a single disease outbreak.

<p>In <a href="disease.html#eq:SIRd">(11.1)</a>, the total transmission rate depends on the density of susceptible hosts. The <em>transmission coefficient</em>, <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span>, describes the instantaneous rate at which the number of infected hosts increases per infected individual. It is directly analogous to the attack rate of type I prey-dependent models. Recall that it is based on the law of mass action, borrowed from physics and chemistry. It assumes that the rate at which events occur (new infections) is due to complete and random mixing of the reactants (<span class="math inline">\(S,\,I\)</span>), and the rate at which the reactants collide and react can be described by a single constant, <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span>. As density of either type of molecule increases, so too does the rate of interaction. In prey-dependent predation, we referred to <span class="math inline">\(aN\)</span> as a linear functional response; here we refer to <span class="math inline">\(\beta S\)</span> as the <em>density-dependent transmission function</em>. The <em>transmission rate</em> is the instantaneous rate for the number of <em>new infections</em> or cases per unit time <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-mccallum2001">McCallum, Barlow, and Hone 2001</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Resistant individuals might be resistant for one of two reasons. They may die, or they may develop immunities. In either case, we assume they cannot catch the disease again, nor spread the disease. As this model assumses a constant population size, we continue to count all <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> individuals, regardless of whether they become immune or die.</p>
<p>The individuals become resistant to this disease at the constant per capita rate, <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span>. The rate <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span> is also the inverse of the mean residence time, or <em>duration</em>, of the disease<a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="&lt;p&gt;This is an interesting phenomenon of exponential processes—the mean time associated with the process is equal to the inverse of the rate. This is analogous to turnover time or residence time for a molecule of water in a well-mixed lake.&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>69</sup></a>.</p>
<p>Disease <em>incidence</em> is the number of new infections or cases occurring over a defined time interval. This definition makes incidence a discrete-time version of transmission rate. Disease <em>prevalence</em> is the fraction of the population that is infected <span class="math inline">\(I/N\)</span>.</p>
<p>A common question in disease ecology is to ask under what conditions will an outbreak occur. Another way of asking that is to ask what conditions cause <span class="math inline">\(\dot{I}&gt;0\)</span>. We can set <span class="math inline">\(dI/dt &gt; 0\)</span> and solve for something interesting about what is required for an outbreak to occur.
<span class="math display" id="eq:sird-threshold">\[\begin{align}
\tag{11.2}
  0 &amp; &lt; \beta IS - \gamma I\notag\\
  \frac{\gamma}{\beta} &amp;&lt; S
\end{align}\]</span>
What does this tell us? First, because we could divide through by <span class="math inline">\(I\)</span>, it means that if no one is infected, then an outbreak can’t happen—it is the usual, but typically unstable equilibrium at 0. Second, it tells us that an outbreak will occur if the absolute density of susceptibles<a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="math inline"&gt;\(S\)&lt;/span&gt; is the absolute density, whereas &lt;span class="math inline"&gt;\(S/N\)&lt;/span&gt; is the relative density.&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>70</sup></a> is greater than <span class="math inline">\(\gamma / \beta\)</span>. If we consider the pre-outbreak situation where <span class="math inline">\(S \approx N\)</span>, then simply making the population size (and density) low enough can halt the spread of disease. This is why outbreaks tend to occur in high density populations, such as agricultural hosts (e.g., cattle), or historically in urban human populations, or in schools.</p>
<p>Vaccinations are a way to reduce <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> without reducing <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span>. If a sufficient number of individuals in the population are vaccinated to reduce <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> below <span class="math inline">\(\gamma / \beta\)</span>, this tends to protect the unvaccinated individuals as well.</p>
<p>Another common representation of this is called the <em>force of infection</em> or <em>basic reproductive rate of the disease.</em> If we assume that in a large population <span class="math inline">\(S \approx N\)</span>, then rearranging <a href="disease.html#eq:sird-threshold">(11.2)</a> gives us
<span class="math display" id="eq:R0">\[\begin{equation}
\tag{11.3}
  R_0=\frac{\beta N}{\gamma}
\end{equation}\]</span>
where <span class="math inline">\(R_0\)</span> is the basic reproductive rate of the disease. If <span class="math inline">\(R_0 &gt; 1\)</span>, then an outbreak (i.e., disease growth) is plausible. Try not to confuse density of resistant hosts, <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span>, with the basic reproductive rate of the disease, <span class="math inline">\(R_0\)</span>. This is analogous to the finite rate of increase of a population where <span class="math inline">\(\lambda&gt;1\)</span>.</p>
<p>Here we model the outbreak of a nonlethal disease (e.g., a new cold virus in winter at university). We assume that the disease is neither life-threatening, and nor is anyone resistant, thus <span class="math inline">\(R=0\)</span>. We can investigate the SIR model by pretending that, as is often the case, we begin with a largely uninfected population and <span class="math inline">\(t=0\)</span>, so <span class="math inline">\(I_0=1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(S_0\approx N\)</span>. We first set parameters. Let’s assume that a cold lasts about a week - that is the duration of the disease, which is <span class="math inline">\(1/\gamma\)</span>. This assumes that the duration ot he cold symptoms are exponentially distributed.</p>

<p>It is important at this point to reiterate a point we made above—<em>these conclusions apply when S, I, and R are densities</em> <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-mccallum2001">McCallum, Barlow, and Hone 2001</a>)</span>. If you increase population size but also the area associated with the population, then you have not changed density. If population size only increases, but density is constant, then interaction frequency does not increase. Some populations may increase in density as they increase is size, but some may not. Mass action dynamics are the same as type I functional response as predators—there is a constant linear increase in per capita infection rate as the number of susceptible hosts increases.</p>

<p>The proper form of the transmission function depends on the mode of transmission <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-mccallum2001">McCallum, Barlow, and Hone 2001</a>)</span>. Imagine two people are on an elevator, one sick (infected), and one healthy but susceptible, and then the sick individual sneezes <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-ellner:2006qe">S. P. Ellner and Guckenheimer 2006</a>)</span>. This results in a particular probability, <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span>, that the susceptible individual gets infected. Now imagine resistant individuals get on the elevator—should adding resistant individuals change the probability that the susceptible individual gets infected? Note what has and has not changed. First, with the addition of a resistant individual, <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> has increased, and prevalence, <span class="math inline">\(I/N\)</span>, has decreased. However, the densities of <span class="math inline">\(I\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> remain the same (1 per elevator). What might happen? There are at least two possible outcomes:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>If sufficient amounts of the virus spread evenly throughout the elevator, adding a resistant individual does <em>not</em> change the probability of the susceptible becoming sick, and the rate of spread will remain dependent on the densities of <span class="math inline">\(I\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span>—the rate will not vary with declining prevalence.</li>
<li>If only the immediate neighbor gets exposed to the pathogen, then the probability that the neighbor is susceptible declines with increasing <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span>, and thus the rate of spread <em>will</em> decline with declining prevalence.</li>
</ol>
<p>It is fairly easy to imagine different scenarios, and it is very important to justify the form of the function. Density- and frequency-dependent transmission are the two most common caricatures.</p>

Figure 11.1: Disease transmission rates vary linearly vs. curvilinearly as functions of the Susceptible and Infected populations in density-dependent vs. frequency-dependent transmission models.
</p>
</div>
<p>What does frequency–dependent transmission imply about dynamics? Let’s solve for <span class="math inline">\(dI / dt &gt; 0\)</span>.
<span class="math display" id="eq:19">\[\begin{align}
  \tag{11.7}
  0 &amp;&lt; \beta \frac{SI}{N} - \gamma I \notag\\
  \gamma &amp;&lt; \beta \frac{S}{N}.
\end{align}\]</span>
As we did above, let’s consider the pre-outbreak situation where <span class="math inline">\(S \approx N\)</span>, so that <span class="math inline">\(S/N \approx 1\)</span>. In that case, the basic reproductive rate is <span class="math inline">\(R_0=\beta/\gamma\)</span>, which is <em>independent of <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span></em>. An outbreak will occur as long as <span class="math inline">\(\beta &gt; \gamma\)</span>, regardless of population density. This is in direct contrast to the density-dependent transmission model (<a href="disease.html#eq:SIRfd1">(11.4)</a>, <a href="disease.html#eq:SIRfd2">(11.5)</a>), where outbreak could be prevented if we simply reduce the population, <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span>, to a sufficently low density. Both modes of transmission are observed in human and non-human populations, so it is important to understand how the disease is spread in order to predict its dynamics.</p>
<p>Another interesting phenomenon with frequency–dependent transmission is that prevalence (<span class="math inline">\(I/N\)</span>) can decline with increasing population size (Fig. <a href="disease.html#fig:SIRfprev">11.2</a>). Two phenomena contribute to this pattern. First, outbreak in a completely susceptible population typically begins with a single individual, and so initial prevalence is always <span class="math inline">\(I/N=1/N\)</span>. Second, as a consequence of this, the transmission rate is lower in larger populations because <span class="math inline">\(\beta SI/N\)</span> is small. As a consequence, prevalence remains low for a relatively long time. In a seasonal population, most individuals in large populations remain uninfected after four months. Depending upon the organism, this could be long enough to reproduce. In contrast, a density–dependent model typically shows the opposite, pattern, with more rapid, extreme outbreaks and greater prevalence in more dense populations (Fig. <a href="disease.html#fig:SIRfprev">11.2</a>).</p>
<p><strong>SIR</strong> dynamics with frequency–dependent transmission (Fig. <a href="disease.html#fig:SIRfprev">11.2</a>).</p>
<p>Here we demonstrate that prevalence can vary with population size (e.g., a smut on plant <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-antonovics1992">Antonovics and Alexander 1992</a>)</span>). Let us assume that resistance cannot be acquired, so <span class="math inline">\(\gamma=0\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(R = 0\)</span>. We can investigate the SIR model by pretending that, as is often the case, we begin with a largely uninfected population and <span class="math inline">\(t=0\)</span>, so <span class="math inline">\(I_0=1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(S_0\approx N\)</span>. We first set parameters.</p>

<p>Let’s start to work with this model—that frequently means making simplifying assumptions. We might start by assuming that if infected and resistant individuals can contribute to offspring, then the disease is relatively benign. Therefore, we can assume that mortality is the same for all groups (<span class="math inline">\(\mu_i= \mu\)</span>). We’ll also assume (again) a constant population size. This means that birth rate equals mortality or <span class="math inline">\(b=\mu\)</span>.</p>
<p>We add additional complexity by allowing transmission to be partially frequency dependent. We introduce a scaling parameter <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span>, where transmission is
<span class="math display">\[\beta I \frac{S}{N^z}\]</span>
so that when <span class="math inline">\(z=0\)</span> we have pure density dependence, and <span class="math inline">\(z=1\)</span> is pure frequency dependence.</p>
<p>Note that if we let <span class="math inline">\(z,\, b,\, \mu =0\)</span>, the we have the simplest SIR model with which we bagn the chapter.</p>
<p>Now imagine a large city, with say, a million people. Let’s then assume that we start of with a population of virtually all susceptible people, but we introduce a single infected person.</p>

<p>Let us further pretend that the disease runs its course over about 10–14 days. Recall that <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span> (gamma) is the inverse of the <em>duration</em> of the disease.</p>

<p>For this model, the force of infection turns out to be <span class="math inline">\(R_0 = 1 + 1 / \left(b\, \alpha\right)\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> is the average age at onset of the disease <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-ellner:2006qe">S.

<p>As with most such enterprises, we wish we knew far more than we do about the which depends on fleas, rodents, humans, and <em>Yersinia pestis</em> on which the dynamics depend. To squeeze this real-life scenario into a model with a small number of parameters requires a few assumptions.</p>
<p>%We begin by assuming, and Kermack and Mckendrick did, that mortality from bubonic plague, in Bombay, in 1905, was quite high, close to 90%. Next, we realize that the only data we have is deaths. Given, however, that the mortality is very high, we might approximate the number of infections by saying that Deaths = 0.9 <span class="math inline">\(\times\)</span> Infections.</p>

<p>We next want to let R find the most accurate estimates of our model parameters <span class="math inline">\(\beta,\,\gamma\)</span>. The best and most accessible reference for this is <span class="citation">B. M. Bolker (<a href="references.html#ref-bolker:2008rr">2008</a>)</span>. Please read the Appendix (for the moment, available on request) for more explanation regarding optimization and objective functions.</p>
<p>Now we create the objective function. An objective function compares a model to data, and calculates a measure of fit (e.g., residual sum of squares or likelihood). Our objective function will calculate the likelihood<a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="&lt;p&gt;Likelihood is proportional the probability of data, given a particular model and its parameters.&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>73</sup></a> of particular values for SIR model parameters. These parameters include <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> of the SIR model. We will also estimate <span class="math inline">\(I_0\)</span>, initial size of the infected population at our <span class="math inline">\(t=0\)</span>. A survey of easily accessed census data suggests the population at the time was in the neighborhood of <span class="math inline">\(\sim 9.5 \times 10^5\)</span> individuals. We also might assume that <span class="math inline">\(I_0\)</span> would be a very small number, perhaps <span class="math inline">\(\sim 1\)</span> in principle, so we will use that. We would really like to estimate <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(I_0\)</span>, but we’ll save that for another day.</p>
<p>Some details about our objective function:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Arguments are transformed parameters (this allows the optimizer to work on the logit<a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content='&lt;p&gt;A logit is the transformation of a proportion which will linearize the logistic curve, logit (p) = &lt;span class="math inline"&gt;\(\log ( p/(1-p) )\)&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>74</sup></a> and log scales).</li>
<li>Transformed parameters are backtransformed to the scale of the model.</li>
<li>Parameters are used to integrate the ODEs using <code>ode</code>, retaining only the resistant (i.e. dead) group (the fourth column of the output); this provides the <em>predicted values</em> given the parameters and the time from onset, and the standard deviation of the residuals around the predicted values.</li>
<li>It returns the negative log-likelihood of the data, given the parameter values.</li>
</ol>
<p>Here is our objective function. Note that its last value is the negative sum of the log-probabilities of the data (given a particular realization of the model).</p>

<p>This gets us some parameter estimates, but they are probably not accurate because the computer couldn’t settle on what it thought was a stable solution (convergence failure. This occurs frequently when we ask the computer to estimate too many, often correlated, parameters for a given data set. Therefore, we have to make assumptions regarding selected parameters. Let us assume for the time being that the two variable estimates are correct, that the population size of the vulnerable population was approximately exp(<code>rround(coef(fit)[3],1)</code>) and the number of infections at the onset of the outbreak was <code>9.6</code>. We will hold these constant and ask R to refit the model, using the default method.</p>
