In spite of the presumptuous title, my goals for this book are modest. I wrote it as the manual I wish I had in graduate school, and a primer for our graduate course in Population and Community Ecology at Miami University.1 To install the latest version of the primer R package, install it directly from GitHub. To do this, install the devtools package. To successfully do that on a Windows operating system, I think you need to install Rtools: https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/ Once you have done all that, use this code: devtools::install_github(\"HankStevens/primer\") Miami University is located in the Miami River valley in Oxford, Ohio, USA; the region is home to the Myaamia tribe that dwelled here prior to European occupation.↩︎ "]
