[["index.html", "Primer of Ecology using R Preface", " Primer of Ecology using R Hank Stevens 2021-08-20 Preface This is based on my book published with Springer, “A Primer of Ecology With R,” part of the Use R! series. To install the latest version of the primer R package, install it directly from GitHub. To do this, install the devtools package. To successfully do that on a Windows operating system, I think you need to install Rtools: https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/ Once you have done all that, use this code: devtools::install_github(&quot;HankStevens/primer&quot;) In spite of the presumptuous title, my goals for this book are modest. I wrote it as the manual I wish I had in graduate school, and a primer for our graduate course in Population and Community Ecology at Miami University.1 Acknowledgements I am grateful for the generosity of early reviewers and readers, each of whom has contributed much to the quality of this work: Jeremy Ash, Tom Crist, David Gorchov, Raphael Herrera-Herrera, Thomas Petzoldt, James Vonesh, as well as several anonymous reviewers, and the students of our Population and Community Ecology class over the past 15 years. I am also grateful for the many conversations and emails shared with four wonderful mathematicians and theoreticians: Jayanth Banavar, Ben Bolker, Stephen Ellner, and Steve Wright — I never have a conversation with these people without learning something. I have been particularly fortunate to have team-taught Population and Community Ecology at Miami University with two wonderful scientists and educators, Davd Gorchov and Thomas Crist. Only with this experience, of working closely with these colleagues, have I been able to attempt this book. It should go without saying, but I will emphasis, that the mistakes in this book are mine, and there would be many more but for the sharp eyes and insightful minds of many other people. I am also deeply indebted to the R Core Development Team for creating, maintaining and pushing forward the R programming language and environment. Like the air I breathe, I cannot imagine my (professional) life without it. I am grateful to all of the developers of packages that have allowed literate programming with Rmarkdown and LaTeX, using RStudio and GitHub. I am indebted to Rachel Collins for her size-structured coneflower data, to Scott Meiners and his colleagues for their generous sharing of data, metadata, and statistical summaries from the Buell-Small Succession Study (http://www.ecostudies.org/bss/). I would like to thank Stephen Ellner for Ross’s Bombay death data and for R code and insight over the past few years. I am also indebted to Tom Crist and his colleagues for sharing some of their moth data (work supported by The Nature Conservancy Ecosystem Research Program NSF DEB-0235369). Last, and most importantly, I would like to thank those of you in my life who make living worthwhile.
