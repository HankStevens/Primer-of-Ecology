abstract={The controversial relationship between productivity and species richness in vegetation is re-examined here in the context of several other important habitat attributes. A simple conceptual model for classifying these attributes and their relationships is developed based on established principles of ecology, evolution and agriculture. Two main predictions derived from this model have important theoretical implications: First, the magnitude of loss in productivity that may result when species are lost from a natural habitat because of extinction, is likely to depend almost entirely upon which species are lost, and should depend only marginally, if at all, upon how many species are lost. Hence, any small role that species richness per se might have in affecting habitat productivity will be detectable only if species composition is controlled explicitly, which has not been the case in several recent empirical studies. Second, the most important determinants predicted for variation in species richness between habitats involve several habitat attributes, but not productivity. The commonly reported decline in species richness across habitats of increasing fertility is not explained in this model by increasing competition intensity as predicted by the popular ``hump-backed'' model. Frequent and intense competitive exclusion of species from highly fertile (and hence, productive) habitats certainly occurs; however, this accounts only for why many non- resident species are not adapted to this habitat type. It does not account for why the species that are adapted to this habitat type, i.e. the resident, successfully recruiting species, are relatively few in number. The present model, however, accounts for this scarcity of resident species in highly fertile habitats based on three possible hypotheses involving three principal habitat attributes: (i) a scarcity of available resource niches, reflecting relatively low environmental heterogeneity; (ii) a scarcity of opportunities for facilitation between species; and/or (iii) a scarcity of available species, reflecting scarce historical opportunities for origination of adapted species in this habitat type.},

abstract={The prominently right-skewed distribution of species sizes has been the subject of a large literature in animal ecology, but has received comparatively little attention from plant ecologists. It is evident that not all explanations that have been offered for animals are directly applicable to plants. We suggest three hypotheses that require further study in the interpretation of size-dependent species richness in plants. These hypotheses are all based on mechanisms that have generated, for smaller plants, a greater historical opportunity for speciation: (i) large adult plant size confers significant adaptation primarily in habitat types that have been relatively uncommon in space, across evolutionary time; (ii) relatively small species are more widely differentiated from each other in the environmental qualities defining their niches, many of which are made possible by the mere presence of larger species residing in the same habitat; and (iii) compared with large species, smaller species generally have higher fecundity allocation, i.e. they can produce a greater number of offspring per unit plant size per unit time, which generally confers a higher premium under most circumstances of natural selection, thus generating a potentially greater number of descendant individuals, and derived species. We discuss the implications of these hypotheses in addressing an underlying paradox in plant competition/coexistence theory, i.e. that large adult size is assumed to be the principal trait that confers competitive ability yet, even in those habitat types where competition is assumed to reach the highest levels of intensity within vegetation, the vast majority of the resident species are, nevertheless, relatively small.

abstract={East Shield (3658 m) and Barcroft Gate (3697 m) Meadows in the White Mountains of California on the Inyo National Forest were selected for a pilot baseline monitoring study over five-year intervals to determine potential effects of future climate change on the meadows. Stated as a hypothesis: given the natural range of temporal variability of meadow vegetation, a significant portion of that variability is attributed to the effects of climatic variation. The study is associated with the Global Observation Research Initiative in Alpine Environments Project (GLORIA) hosted by the University of California White Mountain Research Station. Both meadows are sedge-rush-grass wet meadows, or fens, which are sustained by surface water in the form of streams and springs. A comprehensive plant list was compiled and the plant species of each meadow were sampled by a point intercept method along two randomly placed transects. The occurrence of all species at predetermined one-meter interval sample points along the transects were recorded, percent occurrence was calculated, and descriptive statistics were done. The monitoring objective is to detect a 20\% biologically meaningful change in the vegetation over time with 90\% confidence, and accept a 10\% chance of a false change error (Type 1 error). Monitoring is planned to be done in conjunction with tracking change in precipitation and temperature. Three indicators of possible climate change were chosen. One indicator is increase in the abundance of those species whose upper range is at or below meadow elevations. The rationale for this indicator is based the 2007 IPCC report estimation that a doubling of atmospheric CO2 will increase global temperature with a best estimate of +3.0 ??C. Assuming that the present general lapse rate of -6.32 ??C per kilometer for the White Mountains will persist, a 3.0 ??C increase may result in an equivalent elevation of the meadows of about +475 m. Published elevation ranges indicate that most recorded species are not likely to be affected by the estimated temperature increase. Second and third indicators are a shift in cover from wet meadow to dry meadow species, and the presence and increase of shrub species resulting from postulated reduced precipitation with drying of meadows and encroachment by surrounding shrubs (sagebrush and rabbitbrush). This monitoring study has the potential to detect long-term responses of vegetation to climate change, and reduce uncertainties and confirm or correct the expected consequences of temperature change. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA.},
