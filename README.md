# Primer-of-Ecology
Second edition of "Primer of Ecology with R"
Primer of Ecology with R (Stevens 2009) describes and implements simple population and community ecology models in R, illustrating both the R language and the theory. This edition updates code using ggplot2 for much of the graphics, and bookdown in RStudio to generate the final document (currently HTML). 
New material includes greater connection to theory using Scheiner and Willig (2011), sections of metabolic scaling, foraging, and mutualisms.
